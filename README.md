# Hearts-Card-Game

This project is a group of python scripts created to play the classic card game "Hearts". The rules are explained below:

Game Summary and Objective:
At the end of the game the goal is to be the player with the least amount of points. When one player hits the agree-upon score (In our case 100 points) or higher, the game ends; and the player with the lowest score wins.

Rules:
-At the end of each round, each player counts the number of hearts they have obtained, gaining 1 point for each. In addition to hearts, the queen of spades also gives points, that being 13 points. 
-Each round there is 13 hearts and a queen of spades. If one player obtains all of them, instead of scoring 26 points, they score 0 and each other player scores an additional 26 points.
-In a four-player game each player is dealt 13 cards
-The player holding the 2 of diamonds starts
-Each round, players must follow by playing the suit first played with a higher number, however if they do not have any more of that suit left they can play any suit
-The owner of the highest played card of the starting suit played that round is the winner of the round once no one can place a higher card of the same suit, they take all the cards and keep them at the side. They start the next round, and cannot start the round with a heart or queen of spades until one has been discarded previously.
-Once all players have used up their cards, players tally points and redeal cards. The game continues until a player hits 100 points.
